## Documentation
- All relevant results can be directly seen in the repository.
- Code is designed in a modular fashion and functions can be individually used when sequentially loaded/read.
- The relevant data JSON's news_history.json and price_daily.json have to be copied directly into the directory for the code to work. These datasets are loaded from the iexCloud API (https://iexcloud.io/docs/api/) from the sources "Historical News" and "Historical Prices".
